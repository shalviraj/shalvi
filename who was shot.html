A lot of effects are used to give it a sense of distance and different materials. It was a fun assignment to learn and present the imagination through only sound effects. Also, to realise how effective just a sound story can be.</h3>

                    It was a dark and stormy night. A homeless man finds shelter in an empty house, whose owner did not come home for a year. He slides the window close, plays the music, throws away his shoes, and lays down on the bed. While listening to the music, he hears someone at the door. He quietly gets up, opens the wardrobe and hides inside with closing the wardrobe shut. Quietly waiting for his fate to unfold.
                    He silently listens to the owner, moving around in the house downstairs. Finally, his heart starts to race when he heard the footsteps approaching the room upstairs where he was hiding. The owner, after opening the room, finds it suspicious and takes out her gun. While looking around, she opens the wardrobe in fear and screams after finding someone.
                    Then, there is a gunshot heard before a body falling on the ground. The story leaves a mystery of whether the owner was shot or the thief.
