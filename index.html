                    <p>I'm Shalvi. I'm from an eastern state in India, called Bihar.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Interaction and Experience Design from the <a href="www.ul.ie">University of Limerick, Ireland</a>.</p>

                    <p>I pursued my bachelor's degree in Fashion and Lifestyle Accessory Design from the <a href="www.nift.ac.in">National Institute of Fashion Technology</a> in India. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and it introduced me to the immensely interesting world of design. I have been enjoying working as a product, graphics & communication designer in various companies across India. I have worked in the areas of product design and development, branding, brand communication, visualisation and graphics.</p>

                    <p>Accompanied by work, I have enjoyed living in different cities. Different lifestyles, food and new friends have made my time in those cities even more special. I enjoy traveling, photography and sometimes doing nothing.</p>
