I was new to the city and roamed around in the city of Limerick for the first time to explore and uncover the beautiful aspects of life here. Scroll down to see the five shortlisted photos.
                    
                    The photos were edited in Photoshop to enhance minor errors while shooting.</h3>

                                The photograph shows a lady sitting outside a cafe doing nothing. She might be waiting for someone or her order but one can appreciate her composed posture which is extremely rare to witness in a busy urban environment.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                Like never before in human history, the urban life has become excessively busy. The photograph shows a girl waiting on a bus stop and browsing her phone. It depicts a life of a person who’s mind is involved in something or other at any given moment.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                The entangle plant is giving life to an otherwise dead concrete wall. In addition to the plant in itself being alive, it’s symbolising the complexity of life in the world and yet being so beautiful.

                                The photograph shows a dog looking at the camera. The emotion it generates is how the dog is craving to get out and play. It makes you think how important freedom is, for every living being.
                                </p>

                                <p> The photograph shows a man standing in between buildings and roads. The image signifies how insignificant life and nature has become. Directing to a much bigger question of “what has human beings done to themselves?”.
                                Another thing to notice in the picture is decorating plants to beautify a building, ironically proving how important nature is.

                    The project taught how to look at a subject from a specific angle. It was a great practive of using Photoshop to achieve what I'm expecting the picture to loo like.
